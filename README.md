✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Getting started

- Checkout the git repo.
- `npm install` within the repo, to install Nx and its plugins.
- `npx nx serve new-main` to (build &) serve the new-main application. This will take care of any dependencies that need to be build too.

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Remote caching

Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster.
